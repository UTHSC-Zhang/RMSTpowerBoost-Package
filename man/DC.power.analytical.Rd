\description{
Performs power analysis for an RMST model when the censoring mechanism
depends on observed covariates. Competing risks are not modeled here.
}
\details{
This function assumes a single censoring process whose hazard depends on covariates
(but not on treatment by default). It fits a Cox model for censoring
\deqn{\Pr(\text{censoring by } t \mid X) = 1 - G(t \mid X)}
using \code{Surv(time, status==0) ~ linear\_terms}, then forms inverse-probability-of-censoring
weights (IPCW) \eqn{w_i = 1/\hat G(Y_i\mid X_i)} evaluated at \eqn{Y_i=\min(T_i,L)}.
The RMST regression \eqn{E[Y_i \mid A_i,X_i]} is then fit by weighted least squares,
and power is derived from a sandwich variance that ignores uncertainty from
estimating \eqn{\hat G}.

Note: \code{dep_cens_status_var} is accepted for API compatibility but is
ignored under this setting (no competing risks are modeled).
