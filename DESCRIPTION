Description: A toolkit for designing studies with a restricted mean survival 
    time (RMST) endpoint. This package provides functions to perform 
    bootstrap-based power and sample size calculations for two-arm studies,
    implementing several modern, direct RMST modeling approaches from the 
    biostatistical literature. Users can select a method based on their 
    study's design and assumptions, including flexible additive models with 
    splines (Zhang & Schaubel, 2024), simple linear models with IPCW for 
    independent censoring (Tian et al., 2014), efficient multiplicative models 
    for high-dimensional stratification (Wang et al., 2019), and models for 
    handling dependent censoring or competing risks (Wang & Schaubel, 2018).
