# **RMSTpowerBoost: Power and Sample Size Calculations for RMST-Based Trials**

---

## üîç Overview

As clinical trials and observational studies increasingly move beyond the restrictive **proportional hazards (PH) assumption**, researchers need flexible alternatives for analyzing time-to-event data. One such approach‚Äî**Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST)**‚Äîhas gained traction due to its clear clinical interpretation and robustness in non-PH settings.

Yet, while RMST-based analysis is growing in popularity, tools for **study design and power calculation** under this framework have lagged behind.

**`RMSTpowerBoost` bridges that gap**‚Äîoffering a powerful suite of methods to design, simulate, and plan RMST-based trials, even under complex censoring mechanisms or nonlinear treatment effects. Whether you prefer point-and-click simplicity or script-based control, `RMSTpowerBoost` has you covered.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ‚úÖ Broad Model Support

Design studies under a range of realistic conditions:

* **Non-Stratified Models**

  * *Linear*: Simple, interpretable modeling.
  * *GAM (Generalized Additive Models)*: Flexible for nonlinear covariate effects.

* **Dependent Censoring Models**

  * Account for censoring that's related to baseline covariates.

* **Stratified Models**

  * *Additive or Multiplicative*: Ideal for multi-center trials with center-specific treatment effects.

### üß† Dual Estimation Methods

For many models, you can choose between:

* **Analytical Approach**: Based on asymptotic variance formulas. Fast and efficient for large-scale simulations.
* **Bootstrap-Based Method**: Simulation-driven, providing greater robustness, especially in smaller or complex datasets.

### üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Web App

No R experience? No problem. A full-featured **Shiny web application** is available, making advanced RMST-based design accessible through an intuitive graphical interface.
